# This README.md file tells about the idea and all files in Project0.

## Video overview of the completed project: https://youtu.be/WXJIIrGvsb8

Project0 showcases basic HTML and CSS tools using a number of web pages. Here are the files and descriptions of what is in them.

1. index.html - is the home page. It has only a navigation menu with links to other pages.
2. basic_html.html - is the first page with some content. It features basic html tags: ordered list, table, image.
3. custom_styles.html - has the content of the first page, but with some styles saved in styles.css.
4. styles.css - is the styles file that has 5 different CSS selector types, 5 different CSS properties, #id selector and .class selector.
5. smaller_screen.html - has basically the same content, but with <meta name="viewport"...> that adjusts the page to the size of the screen on the user. (check it out on a phone size screen)
6. responsive_heading.html showcases a heading that changes depending on screen width.
7. bootstrap4.html showcases bootrstrap styling for the entire page, and Alerts component for the list items, and for bootstrap grid items as well.
8. sass_basics.scss contains SASS code for generating sass_basics.css styling file with list item colored blue with nested structure and h2 elements inheriting styling templated in heading2. And sass_basics.html shows that.

Requirements

Alright, now it’s time to make your website your own. Design a personal webpage about yourself, one of your interests, or any other topic of your choice. The subject matter, look and feel, and design of the site are entirely up to you, subject to the following requirements:

1. Your website must contain at least four different .html pages, and it should be possible to get from any page on your website to any other page by following one or more hyperlinks.
2. Your website must include at least one list (ordered or unordered), at least one table, and at least one image.
3. Your website must have at least one stylesheet file.
4. Your stylesheet(s) must use at least five different CSS properties, and at least five different types of CSS selectors. You must use the #id selector at least once, and the .class selector at least once.
5. Your stylesheet(s) must include at least one mobile-responsive @media query, such that something about the styling changes for smaller screens.
6. You must use Bootstrap 4 on your website, taking advantage of at least one Bootstrap component, and using at least two Bootstrap columns for layout purposes using Bootstrap’s grid model.
7. Your stylesheets must use at least one SCSS variable, at least one example of SCSS nesting, and at least one use of SCSS inheritance.
--- DONE till this line ---
8. In README.md, include a short writeup describing your project, what’s contained in each file, and (optionally) any other additional information the staff should know about your project.
